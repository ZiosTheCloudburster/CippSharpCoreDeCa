# CippSharpCore-DebugCanvas
A useful canvas where logs will be printed during runtime.

### Content:
Contains the main code DebugCanvas.cs, 
one scene with DebugCanvas Ready

### Notes:
This works at runtime in some platforms even with disabled debug options in build settings (for example on android mobile). 

### How to Install:
- Option 1 (readonly) now it supports Unity Package Manager so you can download by copy/paste the git url in 'Package Manager Window + Install From Git'. As said this is a readonly solution so you cannot access all files this way.
- Option 2 (classic) download this repository as .zip; Extract the files; Drag 'n' drop the extracted folder in your unity project (where you prefer).
- Option 3 (alternative) add this as submodule / separate repo in your project by copy/paste the git url
